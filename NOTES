= BetaBrite Release Notes

== 0.0.2

This release comes with new syntax for setting attributes of
BetaBrite::String and BetaBrite::TextFile.  Setting attributes like color
and character set is now less cumbersome.  For example, here is the old
way to set the color using constants:
  s = BetaBrite::String.new("hello")
  s.color = BetaBrite::String::Color::GREEN
Instead you can do this:
  s = BetaBrite::String.new("hello") { |a|
    a.set_color "green"
  }
You can treat TextFile similarly:
  s = BetaBrite::TextFile.new { |a|
    a.set_mode "compressed_rotate"
    a.set_position "middle"
  }
These special set functions figure out what constant you want and set it
to the attribute you want.  "set_mode" looks up the name passed in in the
constants stored in the Mode class, and sets it to the mode attribute.


== 0.0.1

This is the first release of the BetaBrite sign library.  Please see the RDoc,
the 'script' directory, and the EXAMPLES file for how to use this library.
